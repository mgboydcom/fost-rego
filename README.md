# FOST Call for Speakers

A web app for running calls for proposals across one or more FOST conferences, built with **Next.js** (App Router, server actions) and **PostgreSQL**.

- **Speakers** create an account and write a proposal once, then send it to one or more conferences, choosing a session format and topic for each. Each conference reviews its copy separately. Speakers can keep editing right up to the day before the conference, and each proposal shows how much time is left. Once accepted, they confirm or decline their slot.
- **The program review committee** scores each proposal from 1 to 5, recommends accept, maybe or reject, and leaves comments. Reviewers see colleagues' reviews only after submitting their own. Anonymous review can be switched on per conference.
- **Organisers (admins)** create conferences (dates, call window, topics, session formats), choose the committee, make decisions one at a time or in bulk, write a message to each speaker, and choose when decisions become visible to speakers.
- **Everything exports to spreadsheets** (`.xlsx`, `.csv` and `.json`) with stable column names, ready for mail merges, Google Sheets, Zapier, Make, Power Automate and similar tools.

## Run it locally

You need **Node.js 20.9 or newer** and **PostgreSQL 14 or newer**.

### 1. Get PostgreSQL running

Pick one:

- **Docker:** `docker compose up -d` starts PostgreSQL with the user, password and database already set up (`fost` / `fost` / `fost_cfp`).
- **Postgres.app (Mac):** install it from postgresapp.com, start it, then run `createdb fost_cfp`.
- **Homebrew (Mac):** `brew install postgresql@17 && brew services start postgresql@17 && createdb fost_cfp`.

### 2. Configure and start the app

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env     # then edit DATABASE_URL if yours differs
npm run db:seed          # optional: demo conferences, speakers and proposals
npm run dev              # http://localhost:3000
```

The database tables are created automatically the first time the app starts (and by `npm run db:seed`). Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply schema updates on their own.

With Postgres.app or Homebrew, your `DATABASE_URL` is usually `postgres://YOUR_MAC_USERNAME@localhost:5432/fost_cfp` (no password).

On a fresh database without the demo data, **the first account you register becomes the organiser (admin)**. Everyone after that is a speaker. Admins add reviewers on each conference's settings page, or change roles under **Organise → People**.

Demo accounts created by `npm run db:seed` (password `password123` for all):

| Email | Role |
| --- | --- |
| admin@example.com | Organiser |
| reviewer1@example.com, reviewer2@example.com | Reviewers |
| ada@example.com, grace@example.com, linus@example.com | Speakers |

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Serve it over HTTPS. Session cookies are marked `Secure` when `NODE_ENV=production`.

### Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (required) |
| `BASE_URL` | Public address of the app, used in exported links (`proposal_url`, `review_url`) and on the exports page |
| `PORT` | Port for `npm start` / `npm run dev` (default 3000) |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | Database for `npm test`; **it is wiped on every run** (default `postgres://fost:fost@localhost:5432/fost_cfp_test`) |

## Proposal lifecycle

```
submitted ──► accepted ──► speaker confirmed / declined
     │    └─► waitlisted
     │    └─► rejected
     └──────► withdrawn (by the speaker, at any time)
```

- New proposals can only be submitted while a conference's call is open. Speakers can keep editing until the day before the conference starts (no start date means no deadline). Each edit bumps `version` and is logged in the proposal history.
- Until an organiser clicks **Publish decisions to speakers**, speakers see "Under review".
- Changing a decision away from accepted clears the speaker's confirmation.

## Spreadsheet exports

Go to **Organise → Spreadsheet exports**. Datasets, one row per item:

| Dataset | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `submissions` | Everything about each proposal: talk details, topic, speaker contact details and country, status, decision visibility, confirmation, message to the speaker, review count, average score and votes, timestamps, links |
| `program` | Accepted talks only, with speaker bio, country, headshot (`speaker_headshot_source`: their photo URL, or their LinkedIn photo if they gave none) and confirmation status |
| `speakers` | One row per speaker with counts of proposals by outcome |
| `reviews` | One row per review |
| `conferences` | Settings and headline numbers |
| `workbook` | All of the above as tabs in one `.xlsx` file |

Signed-in admins download from `/admin/export/<dataset>.<csv|xlsx|json>`. For automation, the same files are served from a secret-token URL that needs no login:

```
/api/export/<token>/<dataset>.<csv|xlsx|json>?conference=<slug>&status=<status>&updated_since=<ISO time>
```

- **Google Sheets:** `=IMPORTDATA("https://your-host/api/export/<token>/program.csv")`
- **Zapier, Make, Power Automate or cron:** poll `submissions.json?updated_since=<last run>` and branch on `status`, `decisions_published` and `speaker_confirmation`.
- **Mail merge:** download `program.xlsx` and merge on `speaker_first_name`, `speaker_email`, `title` and `feedback_to_speaker`.

The token is shown on the exports page and can be regenerated there. Treat it like a password. In CSV output, cells that start with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` are prefixed with `'` so spreadsheets don't run user-entered text as a formula.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev         # development server with hot reload
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript
npm test            # integration tests against TEST_DATABASE_URL (wiped each run)
```
